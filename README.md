# 🛡️ Knockd Service Manager 🛡️

This script automates the installation, configuration, and hiding of the `knockd` service, which allows you to control system services (e.g., start/stop) using port knocking. It also hides the `knockd` service and binds its process ID (PID) to `/var/empty` for added security.

---

## 🚀 **Features**
- Installs and configures `knockd` automatically.
- Allows you to define a custom service to control (e.g., `apache2`, `docker.service`, etc.).
- Hides the `knockd` systemd service by renaming it to `.kernel-loop.service`.
- Binds the `knockd` process to `/var/empty` for added stealth.

---

## 🛠️ **Prerequisites**
- A Linux-based system (tested on VMs).
- Root access (the script must be run as root).
- `apt` package manager (for Debian/Ubuntu-based systems).

## 📜 **How It Works**
1. **Install `knockd`**: The script installs `knockd` using `apt`.
2. **Configure `knockd.conf`**: It creates a custom `knockd.conf` file to define port sequences for starting and stopping a specified service.
3. **Hide the `knockd` Service**: The script renames the `knockd` service file to `.kernel-loop.service` to make it less visible.
4. **Bind Mount `/proc/<PID>`**: It captures the PID of the `knockd` process and binds it to `/var/empty` to obscure it further.
